# Clima Weather App
This is a Flutter based app for retrieving and displaying weather data in your location. The OpenWeatherMap API was used to achieve this. Additionally, I added a 'search location' feature by calling the Google Maps API. This provides a drop-down list of autocompleted locations as the user starts typing in the search box. The user can select one of the suggestions and get weather updates for that location.
